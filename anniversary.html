	<b>	.･ﾟﾟ･°˖✧{I love you to the moon and back}✧˖°･ﾟﾟ･.
		
		October 26, 2021, I feel like the universe and all galaxies had a talk and said, “yeah, it’s time”. I can’t believe that it’s already been a year since we first started dating, time really flies when I spend it with you. Happy Anniversary Keona Kathleen Lacsa Alindogan, the love of my life, my only one, my honeybunch, my babycakes, my jinji, my habibi, my everything, and my sobrang daming endearments. Our relationship is just the best, it was so unexpected hihi imagine, everything started the day I joined your world sa genshin just to kill an unusual hilichurl HAHAHAHA The most beautiful thing is that I wasn’t even looking when I found you. Keonacakes you’re more than just the love of my life, you’re the person I need to talk to when I am having a bad day. You’re the person I rely on when things are rough since I know that I will be safe with you. I wonder what I did to be so lucky and have you in my life, I will never meet someone I can trust as much as I trust you!! You know babe, I really think that most people search their whole lives just to fine what we already have. I just can’t help but to smile while writing this letter for you, I love you so much and I really mean it. ₍ᐢ .  ̫.ᐢ₎♡₍ᐢ. ̫ .⑅ᐢ₎  </b>
</p>
<p id="p11">
	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
	<b>Words couldn’t describe just how much I love and care for you. I want to cuddle with you for as long as I can. You are the most beautiful woman I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. You’re just so unbelievable, I don’t understand how someone can be so beautiful inside and out. I really appreciate everything that you do to me, I am also so proud of everything you have accomplished. Please take care of yourself and I am always here for you. Being with you already makes me the happiest person in the world. ( ˶ˆᗜˆ˵ )  </b>
</p>
<p id="p11">
	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
	<b>I want to make sure that you are always treated right, you deserve all the care, comfort, love, reassurance and everything this world can offer. I don’t want you to stay up late thinking of you did something wrong, kaya I will do my best to be honest with you. Babe, I want you to feel safe and comfortable being around me. I am always willing to give you as much reassurance as you need <33 </b>
</p>
<p id="p11">
	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
	<b>If ever there’s one thing I am sure, that’s not my answers sa school HAHAHAHAHAHA I am sure that you have always belonged to me, soulmate things mwehehehehe. You’re my soulmate, and we help each other to complete ourselves. On this day you confessed to me and you know, I had no doubts when I said yes and you walked into my life as if you have always lived there, kaya I really think na it’s a home built just for you. The moment I started to fall in love with you, I already knew what happily ever after feels like. ૮₍ ˃ ᵕ ˂ ₎ა </b>
</p>
<p id="p11">
	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
	<b>Keong, I want you to know that all of your efforts were never wasted, I adore and appreciate every thing you do, and I love you because you always make me feel that I am worth something.  I love you and every little pieces of you and I love you for simply being you. Babucakes you really mean the world to me and I can’t imagine myself living without you by myside. I am the luckiest guy knowing that I have you. I always miss you kahit ilang saglit pa yan, you’re just the sweetest, most supportive and caring person I ever met. All the memories we’ve had together have been a bliss and there are many more to come hihi. I will do anything just to be with you so let’s stay together for eternity. I promise that I will never leave you and will always fight for our relationship whatever problem we face in the future.  </b>
</p>
<p id="p11">
	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
	<b>I feel like it’s an understatement when I say that you’re the prettiest, smexiest, loveliest person I’ve ever known because words are just not enough to describe you my one and only Keonacakes <333 Babe it’s that connection we can’t explain. I will always choose you in every universe and I will seek you amongst the stars. I love you into the infinity of the universe. Your smile makes my heart skip a bit, and when I am with you, I feel so complete. In those arms of yours is the place where I belong, it is where I will feel at home. Your eyes hold everything that my soul thirsts for and your voice gives me butterfly in my stomach. ૮꒰ ˶• ༝ •˶꒱ა  </b>
</p>
<p id="p11">
	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
	<b>Keona you’re my best friend, lover, and soulmate all wrapped up in the prettiest package. You’re like no one, and that is why I am so addicted to you. Babu you’re the safest place I’ve ever known and I can be soft to you no matter how hard life gets. You’re always there for me and I want you to feel the same. Your love can be felt deep in my bones, in my soul. I am terrified of losing you so let’s hold on to each other. ˶ˆ꒳ˆ˵  </b>
</p>
<p id="p11">
	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
	<b>I promise to love you unconditionally, I am willing to endure all of the pain just to be with you. Days will not always be full of happiness but, always remember that I will never let go of you. We have a connection that even an eternity doesn’t seem long enough to spend with you. You’re who I’ve waited for all my life and I know there is something eternal between us. My love for you is true, it defies all reasons for I do not look for reasons to love you, I see beyond reasons, and all I see is you.    </b>
</p>
<p id="p11">
	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
	<b>When Ben&Ben said “pipiliin ka sa araw-araw” I already knew na it’s you, the intensity of love will never be the same everyday but, I will still choose you every second, minute, hour and days and it will always be you every single day. (づ˶•༝•˶)づ♡   </b>
</p>
<p id="p11">
	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
	<b>Always remember that it’s okay if you feel sad, don’t know the answer, made a mistake, need to rest, struggle to stay positive, don’t know what to do, have your boundaries, feel insecure, and more. There’s nothing wrong with that and that’s what makes you perfectly imperfect. I will always love and respect you. I am so in love with you and it’s crazy, I want this relationship to last forever. I cherish you more than anything and you are constantly on my mind. You are perfect for me, and your attention is all I need. Can you promise me that no matter what happens we will stick together through the good and bad times and we will always be there for each other?     </b>
</p>
<p id="p11">
	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
	<b>I never thought that I will love someone as much as I love myself when I am alone. You brought me into a place where I would choose you over solitude. I appreciate you with every piece of me, and I am willing to dismantle myself just to put you back together. I love you just the way you are, there’s no need to be perfect, perfect should be the one trying to be you. ૮₍˶ •. • ⑅₎ა ♡    </b>
</p>
<p id="p11">
	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
	<b>I am sorry if I hurt you, I am sorry for all the bad things I’ve done to you. But I am not sorry that it is you whom I’ve fallen to. Nothing will ever exhaust me when it comes to comforting you, I am willing to stay up late until all your tears are gone, until all your melancholic thoughts leave you. Touching you was like realizing all I ever wanted was right in front of me. I love you today, tonight, tomorrow and forever. If I were to live a thousand years, I will choose to be with you, and if I were to live a thousand lives, I would want to make you mine in each one. I will choose you to struggle and succeed with, to love and grow old with. I choose you knowing that they are still plenty of trails to travel and knowing that there are more mountains left to climb.     </b>
</p>
<p id="p11">
	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
	<b>You deserve every star to shine for you the way my eyes do. I crave you, the sweetness of your voice, the softness of your touch, and the kindness of your heart. I love you no matter how far you are and when my screen lights up with a notification with your name, so do I. Before you, I never understood how feelings and emotions could find their ways into text messages. I can’t wait for the day we will wake up in the morning, reach to the side of the bed and hold each other so closely. You are forever the name stitched into my heart, all day and every day. You stole my heart and I have no complaints. I love me better when I am with you, I have many insecurities but, when I am with you all of those doesn’t matter anymore and that’s because you love and accept me for who I am and I also feel the same thing for you. A love that is pure, a love that doesn’t judge.     </b>
</p>
<p id="p11">
	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
	<b>I want to thank you for the endless things that you do for me and for loving me endlessly. I am very thankful for your patience specially when I am being stubborn. Thank you for making time for me and staying by myside <33 Thank you for always choosing me, but don’t forget to prioritize yourself first. Thank you for being there both during the highs and lows in our relationship. You’re both my motivation and inspiration. To summarize it all, thank you for everything and I am very thankful for being part of your life. ૮⸝⸝> ̫ <⸝⸝ ა     </b>

	<b>Keona Kathleen Lacsa Alindogan, you are exactly, precisely and perfectly what I waited for ૮꒰ ˶• ༝ •˶꒱ა ♡ I’ll love you until my very last breath and every beat of my heart is yours. You’re more than enough and I’ll always be there for you. Your eyes make me wander to a place I don’t belong to, a place so calming, soothing and filled with love. Your arms provide me the warmth I’ve never felt before. Your hug is the purest form of touch that I’ve known as if you’re telling me that everything will be fine and you’ll always be there for me when things are rough. I love you not only for who you are, but also for who I am when I am with you. (⸝⸝⸝╸▵╺⸝⸝⸝)     </b>
</p>
<p id="p11">
	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
	<b>My heart beats, breaks, loves and aches for you, and only for you. In yours eyes I see an ocean and every time I stare at them, feelings hit me like waves. Are you a bee? I want you to turn me into your honey ♡´･ᴗ･`♡ I know I’ve already said that I love you a lot of time, but I want you to know that there are no lies in those words, not one a bit. Each moment I spent with you means everything to me, I want to be with you forever. Babe you can’t comprehend how much I love and care for you. Come to me with your flaws, scars and everything you consider imperfect and I will never get tired of reminding you how much lovely you are. We are two souls destined for each other, I am the rhythm and yours was a beat. ૮⸝⸝ >  ꇴ <⸝⸝ づ━☆*:･ﾟ✧    </b>

	<b>Hey babucakes, just incase you foolishly forget, I am never not thinking of you. You are 24/7 in my mind and I have no complaints. Like breathing, loving you just feels so natural and I will love you until the end of time. * ੈ♡‧₊˚૮ ˶ ᵕ ᴗ ᵕ ˶ ა* ੈ♡‧₊˚    </b>
